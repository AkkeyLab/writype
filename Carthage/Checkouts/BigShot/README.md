#BigShot



BigShot is written purely in Swift, its a simple implementation that manipulates the UIWindow's frame to take long vertical screenshots, no need to scroll and take multiple screenshots.

## Installation  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Carthage

    github "https://github.com/tapthaker/BigShot"

## Usage (•ิ_•ิ)?

**Nothing to do here**, things will work automatically, just shake the iPhone to take screenshot of your app. YAY **＼（＾ ＾）／**.

In case you need it, call the takeBigShot method on UIWindow for your custom implementation.
